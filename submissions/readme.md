 # HPRC_metadata

 This repo stores metadata for various R2 submissions. Ideally, every folder in submissions/ should have:
 * A submission CSV or TSV, sent to us from the submitter
 * A wrangled data table CSV
 * At least one "processed ok" TSV from SRA
 * A `__final.csv` representing the final please-don't-touch-this metadata
 * A folder-level readme.md file with any relevant notes and a few lines that can be copy-pasted into the validator script for an immediate run (see below)

 There is a script in utils/ designed to validate metadata tables from simple column/sample swaps. It uses Ash's ranchero library, which is essentially a wrapper for python-polars. Currently, ranchero cannot be pip installed; you will need to `git clone https://github.com/aofarrel/ranchero.git` in order to import its src/ directory. Instructions for running it can be found in `utils/readme.md` and the script itself.

## Important stuff!

### Should be removed from SRA/AnVIL
* HIC_Y3_Y4_part2's corrupt files (not on SRA but likely on AnVIL)
* some files from HPRC_DEEPCONSENSUS_v1pt2_2023_08_q20
* WUSTL_HPRC_HiFi_Year1 subreads
	* Alternatively we could just leave them up on SRA? They are correctly marked as subreads in the title field...
* Possible duplicate uploads?

### Missing submissions
Not exhaustive:
* HiC (all of these ones seem to already be on SRA)
* HG00733_T2T_UW_HiFi_ONT
* HPRC_REVIO_EA_2023
* NISC_HiFi_TopUp_2022_with_5mC


## Progress table

‚úÖ = all files uploaded -- done and dusted -- everything should be fine **(for SRA this means n uploaded = n in data table; if n in data table changes this should be revisited)**  
	* check what I wrote in the PR description (there may be minor changes you should be aware of)  
	* pull in the PR   
	* merge the new `*__final.csv` file with your master data table  
üÖ∞Ô∏è = all files in data table are uploaded, but there are more files in the AWS tables or submission tables  
	* if you're certain nothing is missing from the data table CSV, consider this equivalent to ‚úÖ (unless another emoji is also present)  
‚ö†Ô∏è = data has metadata issues (if in SRA column, files were still uploaded)   
üü° = probably could be partially uploaded
üü† = partially uploaded to SRA ergo cannot be fully validated  
‚ùì = pending...  
‚ùå = file count mismatch that isn't just an AWS or submissions thing / some other kind of annoying blocker

## Metadata conflict handling (not automatically handled by validate_and_combine_per_submission.py, you gotta add these as ignores if they aren't already in the ignore lists)
Inconsistenies we truly do not care about:
* Basically equivalent instrument models like "PacBio Revio" becoming "Revio"

Overrides:
* polymerase_version

Null-fill:
* notes
