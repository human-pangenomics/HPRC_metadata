# hic_add_to_index Samples

## Overview
This directory contains Hi-C sequencing data samples that were included in HPRC Data Release 1 and subsequently re-wrangled for Data Release 2 to generate standardized metadata.
## Release Information
	•	Original Release: Data Release 1
	•	Re-wrangled for: Data Release 2 (metadata generation only)
	•	Current Status: Available in working directory structure
## Important Notes
### Original Submission Metadata
Original submission metadata is not available for these samples. The samples underwent re-wrangling during Data Release 2 processing solely for the purpose of generating consistent metadata formats and organizational structure.
### Sample Status
These samples were previously released as part of Data Release 1 and are currently available in the working directory structure. The re-wrangling process for Data Release 2 did not modify the underlying sequencing data - only metadata generation and organizational consistency were addressed.
