## HPRC-OmniC-100124Pools

These files are not in the R2 Index master document, but some of them have BioSamples, so those have been submitted to SRA.

The ones that WERE uploaded, and WERE in HPRC-OmniC-100124Pools_sra.csv, are in uploaded_to_SRA.tsv

The ones that WERE NOT uploaded, but were in HPRC-OmniC-100124Pools_sra.csv, are in require_BioSample_before_SRA_upload.tsv

There is also a bunch of samples NOT in HPRC-OmniC-100124Pools_sra.csv but ARE in HPRC-OmniC-100124Pools_data_table.csv; those were not touched.

Submission CSV has 192 filenames
Wrangled CSV has 192 filenames (loss: 0)
TSV has 60 filenames (loss: 132)


Validation of the ones that were uploaded (you will also need to remove parts of the script that check the TSV and wrangled have same number of values, and also this will show you a ton of metadata that didn't nullfill properly)
